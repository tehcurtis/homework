###Notes about this answer

I decided to use just plain old ruby
objects for modelling these objects out. Due to the
fact that these objects are so simple, I could just use them
in the specs themselves and not test doubles. There are a quite
a bit more I could do with these objects (and specs!) but I think this is a good start.

In a rails app (with an actual db), some moving and renaming would definitely have to take place.
